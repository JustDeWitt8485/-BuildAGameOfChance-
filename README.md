# Assessment: Build a Game of Chance
Implement at least one of the following games using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This will be a project you include in your portfolio, so make it look nice, and use GitLab's Pages feature to host your finished game so that anyone can play it.

All these games will need generate random numbers, like in the dice-rolling activity from a few weeks ago.

Roughly speaking, the ones listed first are easier than the ones listed later (your mileage may vary).

If you are looking for additional challenges, you can add a lot of "polish" to any of these games by adding hover effects and animations.
